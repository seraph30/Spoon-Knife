All that's missing is the fork. Heh.



mkdir ~/Hello-World
# Creates a directory for your project called "Hello-World" in your user directory

cd ~/Hello-World
# Changes the current working directory to your newly created directory

git init
# Sets up the necessary Git files
# Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/you/Hello-World/.git/

touch README
# Creates a file called "README" in your Hello-World directory


git clone https://github.com/seraph30/Spoon-Knife.git
# Clones your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal


cd Spoon-Knife
# Changes the active directory in the prompt to the newly cloned "Spoon-Knife" directory
git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
# Assigns the original repository to a remote called "upstream"
git fetch upstream
# Pulls in changes not present in your local repository, without modifying your files


git push origin master
# Pushes commits to your remote repository stored on GitHub
